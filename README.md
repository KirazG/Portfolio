### Projects
* Data manipulation using pandas 

I conducted exploratory data analysis on Billboard hits in 2000 to see what interesting insights you can gain from the data.

* Predicting data science salaries 

* Tweet classification and sentiment analysis

I looked at tweets from Breitbart News and The Onion to see how similar they were. I also conducted sentiment analysis on the tweets to see if one was more subjective or polarizing than the other.
