### Projects
#### Data manipulation using pandas 

I conducted exploratory data analysis on Billboard hits in 2000 to see what interesting insights you can gain from the data.

#### Predicting Congressional bill passage

I set out to predict whether or not a Congressional bill would pass based on summaries (provided by the CRS) alone. I'll be building on this extensively, including using LDA to cluster bills into separate categories, and incorporating roll calls to try to predict which way an individual member of the House would vote. 
#### Tweet classification and sentiment analysis

I looked at tweets from Breitbart News and The Onion to see how similar they were. I also conducted sentiment analysis on the tweets to see if one was more subjective or polarizing than the other.
